# ⚛️ LUXBIN - Photonic Binary Language

**A language where colors are letters and shades are grammar**

## What is LUXBIN?

LUXBIN is a photonic binary language where semantic information is encoded directly in the physical properties of light. Instead of using traditional text or binary digits, LUXBIN uses color and light to communicate.

### Key Concepts

- **Hue (0°-360°)** = Letter identity (A-Z)
- **Saturation** = Part of speech (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)
- **Lightness** = Tense/mode (Present, Past, Future, Conditional)
- **Timing** = Word and sentence boundaries

### How It Works

1. **26 Letters**: A-Z are mapped to hue values from 0° to 140.625° in 5.625° steps
2. **Grammar Encoding**: Saturation and lightness encode grammatical information
3. **Visual Output**: Text is converted to a sequence of colored blocks
4. **Binary Foundation**: 6-bit indexing (64 total symbols possible)

## Features

This demo lets you:

- 📤 **Encode Text**: Convert any text into LUXBIN color sequences
- 🎨 **Visual Alphabet**: See the complete hue wheel with all 26 letters
- 📚 **Grammar Guide**: Understand how saturation and lightness encode grammar
- ℹ️ **Learn More**: Explore the complete LUXBIN specification

## Applications

- **Assistive Technology**: Non-verbal communication
- **Secure Communication**: Line-of-sight only, hard to intercept
- **Extreme Environments**: Underwater, space, RF-denied zones
- **Human-Machine Interfaces**: Direct photonic signaling

## Technical Details

- **Alphabet Size**: 26 letters + 38 extended symbols (64 total)
- **Color Space**: HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
- **Binary Base**: 6-bit indexing
- **Temporal Encoding**: 100ms/letter, 200ms/word, 500ms/sentence

## Created By
